This is a simple distributed (music) radio station for Android. 

Here's how to use it:

- Install the app on multiple devices on the same WiFi network.
- As soon as the app's fired up on the devices, they find each other, referring to each other using a username supplied the first time the app is used.
- The app shows an interface to control music playback, with a 'play/pause' and 'next' button.
- Clicking on 'Play' on device-A starts streaming and playing the first song in the music library on device-B.
- Clicking 'Next' plays the first song on device-C, and then goes on to the first one on device-D and so on.
- After one iteration, the next set of songs are played in a round-robin fashion.
- All music is streamed P2P, without other (server) components, and devices can play music while sourcing music to other devices.
- Other data shown on the interface are - the song, artist and  album name, a progressbar showing the progress, elapsed and remaining time and the name of the user 
  serving the song. 
- The speed of streaming is dependent on the LAN speed (intranet).
- Multi-hop mesh networks are also supported, in that the devices need not be on the same subnet.
- However, in this version of the app, they can only be at a maximum of 1 subnet away, i.e, devices should be on the same or adjacent subnets.
- Music is played as soon as soon as a minimum buffer's worth of data is streamed from a peer, and is updated everytime 3 seconds worth of playback is streamed.
- Each song is buffered only till it is played, and is then erased on the consuming device.
